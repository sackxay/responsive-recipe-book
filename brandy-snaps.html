      <h2 class="subheader">Preperation</h2>
      <p>Whisk together flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, salt, cloves, nutmeg and cayenne pepper; set aside.</p>
      <p>Beat butter and brown sugar with electric beaters until light and fluffy, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Beat in egg until combined. Stir in molasses and vanilla until blended. Stir in dry ingredients; beat just until blended. Cover and let stand in refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. (This will make them easy to roll and shape.)</p>
      <p>Preheat oven to 375&#176;F. Using a tablespoon to measure, roll dough into roughly 1-inch balls. Roll the balls in sugar to coat and place on parchment paper-lined baking sheets, spacing about 2-inches apart. Press dough with tines of fork in a crisscross pattern to flatten slightly. Top with a pinch more sugar. (If the dough is too soft to work with, pop in freezer for a few minutes to firm up.)</p>
      <p class="push">Bake in middle of the oven, one tray at a time, until the cookies are set around the edges but still a little soft in the centre, about 9 to 11 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.</p>

      <h2 class="subheader">Recipe notes:</h2>
      <p>For fully-loaded ginger cookies, add chopped pecans, white chocolate chunks and chopped crystallized ginger to the dough.</p>
      <p>Coarse sugar for cookies, also called decorative or sanding sugar can be found at bulk food stores. It really does make the ginger cookies sparkle but granulated sugar is just as pretty and delicious.</p>

Snaps:
55 g butter
55 g demerara sugar
55 g golden corn syrup
50 g all-purpose flour
½ tsp ground ginger
½ tsp lemon juice
Filling:
240 g whipping cream
8 g skim milk powder
1 tsp Grand Marnier
2 tbsp powdered sugar
Preparation
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two baking trays with parchment.
Measure the butter, sugar and syrup into a small saucepan.
Heat gently over a low heat until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved, about 15 minutes. Don’t let the mixture boil.
Leave the mixture to cool slightly, about 2 - 3 minutes, then sieve in the flour and ginger. Pour in the lemon juice and mix thoroughly.
Drop 1 teaspoon of the mixture per cookie onto the prepared baking trays and spread to make a small circle. Bake no more than 3 cookies at a time, about 10 cm apart.
Bake 7 - 9 minutes, or until the mixture is spread out, lacey and a deep golden colour. If under-baked, the biscuits will not hold their shape; if overbaked, they will crack when you try to roll them.
Working quickly, remove the circles from the pan one at a time, using a small offset spatula. Place cookie upside down, then gently roll the warm cookie around the handle of a wooden spoon. Lightly press where the cookie overlaps to keep the roll together. Slide the cookie off the spoon and leave it to firm up (joint side down) on the wire rack. Let cool on rack. Repeat until you have enough cookies to fill.
If the mixture in the sauce pan becomes too firm, warm it up by rolling a teaspoonful into a small smooth ball in your hands, then place on the baking tray and flatten slightly with your fingers.
Make the cream filling: whip cream with 2 tbsp of powdered sugar to stiff peaks. Fold in Grand Marnier.
Pipe into each brandy snap.
Servings: Makes 20 perfectly-filled snaps
